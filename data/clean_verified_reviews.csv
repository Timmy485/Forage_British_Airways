worst experience life trying deal customer service british airways. many issues getting one destination other. absolutely horrible time trying get answers reach anyone capable helping navigate uncertainties. wrote formal complaint requesting type refund received generic “we sorry” email 5000 avios attached equivalent maybe $50 $600+ flight. needless say go waste refuse fly untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline couldn’t even address one single issue expressed them. equivalent handing band aid slapping face. say flight smooth onboard staff kind attentive. frustrating thing customer service trained give runaround heavily point exhaustion give trying take loss.
"due code sharing cathay pacific downgraded ba return leg. can’t describe cheated felt. booked paid airline great entertainment, food service, instead, forced go hungry one choice meal inedible. ensure passengers didn’t get funny ideas assume vegetarian option unavailable might given cracker small packet nuts. cabin crew announced uniquely aggressive dismissive way “you won’t get anything else 12 hours know!” entertainment compiled mainly b movies paid £11 wi-fi could watch netflix laptop. unsurprisingly, signal weak couldn’t even send email. add insult injury, earbuds provided cheapest lowest quality ever seen. since last time used airline crew less rude obnoxious impatient unhelpful. don’t understand seems british airways look characteristics desirable attributes crew."

"flown ba many years time 10 years ago getting better. sadly trip underlines slipped versus airlines. booking time, one scammed extortionate amount book seat. heathrow t5 check queues unbelievably long staff bag drop curt say least. lounges remain awful overcrowded ba invested many years. flight food okay, although portions kept minimal. one days crew could give damn service mostly absent entire flight. next time change ceo, better recruiting aa second rate, budget irish airline."

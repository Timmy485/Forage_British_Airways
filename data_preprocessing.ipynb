       "['Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.',\n",
       " 'Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.',\n",
       " \"LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was\\xa0the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping.\",\n",
       " \"I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it.

The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class.',\n",
       " 'Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. My food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down. We expected so much more.',\n",
       " 'I enjoyed my flight. The boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional. The food selection was good and I enjoyed the quality. The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes. I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week.',\n",
       " 'Why do you make it so hard? After a so so lounge experience, the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt. It can’t be training, who would do that, it has to be no fear of anything happening. The “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy. The crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather odd. Essentially, there was one only main that I could handle and was then told they had ran out. I was a few rows in.',\n",
       " 'After several delays and canceled flights, we finally made it to Copenhagen on American Airlines and British Airways flights. My luggage was destroyed, wheels torn off. I had to buy new luggage in Denmark. I made a claim with British Airways to reimburse me but because I didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage, they would only cover 50% of my new luggage. Advice, have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like I did.',\n",
       " \"I swore I would never fly BA again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to Budapest. But the times for their flights suited me so I decided to give them another go. The flight left on time (just about), the cabin was clean and the staff friendly. There was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy. The flight was pleasant enough and I can't think of any negatives to write about. The flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet.\",\n",
       " 'Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.',\n",

Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water. When walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat. Horrible flight with disappointing staff. Customer service is terrible and online check-in never worked because BA never verified our COVID documents which were uploaded in advance, resulting me and my wife seated separately. I’ve lost respect for British Airways. Disgusted.',\n",
       " 'I have flown with BA for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting better. Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines. At booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight. Next time they change CEO, can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate, budget Irish airline.',\n",
       " 'Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be.',\n",
       " 'Very poor service, very frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.',\n",
       " \"We have flown repeatedly with British Airways and the One World alliance over the last few weeks. Every flight was delayed. Now we are back at the airport in Miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight. Finally, our luggage arrived in Puerto Rico with a 3-day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip ... we haven't received any information about our luggage to this day, luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there. The last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they can't do anything.  Wir sind in den letzten Wochen immer wieder mit Britisch Airways und dem One World Zusammenschluss geflogen. Jeder Flug war verspätet. Nun sitzen wir wieder in Miami am Flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive Verspätung sodass wir unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werden. Zuletzt ist auch unser Gepäck mit 3 Tagen Verspätung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine Info über unser Gepäck erhalten, zum Glück haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… Beim letzten verpspäteten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch sie ihre Anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben Flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen.\",\n",
       " \"I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it's just a sip. On the shorter flights the seats couldn't even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board.\",\n",
       " 'The worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats, very low cost style and uncomfortable. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. Catering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate bar for a 5 hours service. Will never fly BA again.',\n",
       " \"First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!\",\n",
       " 'The latest affront. Stood in first class line for an hour. Finally go up front and the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of us. Arrogant and unapologetic. Add this to a long list of post-Covid disappointments. We are done with BA.',\n",
       " 'I tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible. I was given no reason for this. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information.

We missed our onward Air Canada flight to Calgary as a result. On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. We are now on our way home only to find our Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours, is now delayed by another 2 hours. Avoid British Airways like the plague.',\n",
       " \"Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.\",\n",
       " 'Plane was over an hour late leaving, no problem that can happen. But on arrival at Heathrow, the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to. Then once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane. Just pathetically inefficient.',\n",
       " 'The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.',\n",
       " \"The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption, wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this.\",\n",
       " \"Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before. AND I wait patiently for my reimbursement. I am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away. Well, you know what I won't.\",\n",

       " 'A short BA euro trip and this is where BA excel. Clean aircraft, good crew, professional, on time (within LHR standards) and a good value product delivered.

The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. As it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund (other than fees) as I had missed the 24 hour cooling off period. Apparently as the ticket was issued in the UK, I needed to contact them. I have now cancelled the ticket and I will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways.',\n",

The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade.

The meal was ok but not great, aside the Champagne no European wines on this flight. Service was friendly but rather slow, no spontaneous refills of drinks offered.

       " 'My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.',\n",

Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid. Without the support of the lovely Althea, her professionalism, her care for us, we would not have make it. She was so sweet, so caring, but at the same time so determined to help, she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities.\",\n",
       " 'Organised boarding process. Really friendly crew. Quick drink and a snack. All in all a great experience. The crew are a credit to BA. The best crew in Europe.',\n",
       " \"Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.\",\n",
       " 'Check in agent at LHR was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew. Seat was comfortable with good leg room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine. In flight entertainment selections we’re very limited. Far inferior to what BA used to offer. Overall, this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money.',\n",
       " 'Very disappointing. I book BA so I can fly during the day. My return flight at 6pm on 28/1/23 was cancelled, replaced by a flight at 9pm. It took off 1/2 hour late meaning I arrived at Gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections. I had to pay £70 for a taxi home. Plus the seats are really snug. I’m only 5’7” but my knees were hitting the seat in front. No more BA for me. They are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated. Ryanair has better aircraft and take-off slots.',\n",
       " 'Excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge, the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket. The Concorde room at Heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip. Flight was slightly delayed out of Heathrow but arrived on schedule in Johannesburg.',\n",
       " 'Good lounge at Cape Town. On time departure. Drinks high quality. Sound dinner service. Breakfast reasonable. Arrival lounge was good but showers cold.',\n",
       " \"A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon, plenty of edible food. Easy boarding. New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard\",\n",
       " 'This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice. \\xa0 I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.',\n",
       " \"A rather empty and quiet flight to Tel Aviv, very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight I had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required. Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us. Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. This was the first time I have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time.\",\n",
       " 'Easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA. Security at London was fast. Galleries North was fine and showers were good. Organised flight boarding. Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product. My wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok. After take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run. Slept well on time arrival. We both found the new seat design harder to sleep in.',\n",
       " 'Being a silver flyer and booking a flight through BA to Dublin you would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA used Air Lingus for the flight. Travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind Gentleman at the desk even though he said I had to be Gold ? He was really accommodating and it wasn’t a big deal. But the two ladies on the desk were like no. No empathy there at all-saying the other guy shouldn’t have let me and they will have a word with him ? Come on BA I booked the flight through you, and you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier.',\n",
       " 'Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average.',\n",
       " 'Probably the worst business class experience I\\'ve ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to \"upload my COVID documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any \"COVID documentation\" - I was informed (several hours later) that my \"COVID documents have been verified\". I then received another text message urging me to \"upload my COVID documentation\". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the \"chicken or fish?\" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a \"ploughman\\'s lunch\" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won\\'t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6\\' 2\" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6\\' 2\" height. The \"Priority\" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.',\n",
       " 'Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen.',\n",
       " 'BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times. It’s reasonable priced, works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips.',\n",
       " 'I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it. IFE didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.',\n",
       " \"Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10. With the luggage fiasco I can't rate it more than 4/10.\",\n",
       " 'BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from \"upcoming flights\" on the day of departure). Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless (why can\\'t the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad what\\'s become of BA.',\n",
       " \"Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future.\",\n",
       " 'Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.',\n",

       " 'Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots.',\n",
       " 'Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs.',\n",

I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport.

The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there.',\n",

About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs.',\n",

I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good.\",\n",

Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).

The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there.

No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal.

The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights.',\n",

We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.\",\n",
       " \"This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA.\",\n",
       " 'Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA.',\n",
       " 'Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey.',\n",
       " 'Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.',\n",
       " \"On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter.\",\n",

And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways.\",\n",
       " 'London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience.',\n",
       " 'A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story.',\n",
       " 'I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival.',\n",
       " 'Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.',\n",
       " 'A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats.',\n",
       " 'Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)',\n",
       " \"Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention.\",\n",
       " \"We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.\",\n",
       " 'While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response.',\n",

Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future.\",\n",

Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR.

Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!',\n",
       " 'Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly.',\n",
       " 'The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.',\n",
       " \"This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class.\",\n",
       " 'My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.',\n",

This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. I was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board.

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled \"priority\". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports.',\n",

This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed.

I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers.

Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK.',\n",
       " 'Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.',\n",

       " 'Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day before. They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare.',\n",
       " 'Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight.',\n",
       " 'Washington to London. Our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. We tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. No one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. We are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!',\n",
       " \"Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.\",\n",
       " 'BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn\\'t book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn\\'t find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I\\'d get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn\\'t fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn\\'t get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn\\'t getting a full refund. I didn\\'t cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. \"Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We\\'re sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim\\'s been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations\".

I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines. Onboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own.  I would think twice to take BA in the future.',\n",
       " 'BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing.',\n",
       " \"This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.\",\n",
       " \"As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the\\xa0Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages\\xa0(I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin.\\xa0I end where I started, BA\\xa0standards continue to slip.\",\n",

Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayed. Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are \"very busy right now\" and our baggage will arrive \"soon.\" Onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. Seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support. Meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when I last flown with BA - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. Cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. Overall, a fairly disappointing experience with BA.',\n",

Food adequate and still served on the same tray. Arrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge. Long queue to get through immigration.',\n",

After 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. We were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage.

It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget.

Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.\",\n",
       " 'As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake.',\n",
       " 'Flight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyond. Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. Rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line. A rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. Will certainly never fly BA again and do not recommend this airline.',\n",
       " 'Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again.',\n",

The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced.

I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me.

After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues.

If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after \"needing\" to put me on hold once more to \"speak with their supervisor.\" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle.',\n",

The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company.

There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket.

However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling!

To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia.

We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the \"Points game\" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.',\n",

You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.

Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA\\'s policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife\\'s smoked salmon bagel was dreadful.

GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass!

Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat.

Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays.

       " \"British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.\",\n",
       " 'We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.',\n",

The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well.

I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.\",\n",

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight.

Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.\",\n",

Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley.

       " \"Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight.\",\n",

The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff.

Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew',\n",

My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to \"Club check-in\" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!',\n",
       " 'I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!',\n",

I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.',\n",
       " 'The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline.',\n",
       " 'Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards.',\n",
       " \"In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.\",\n",
       " \"After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!\",\n",
       " 'I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I\\'d be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I\\'d be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I\\'d be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn\\'t add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with \"That\\'s the final amount.\" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they\\'ve yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me.',\n",
       " 'Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze.',\n",
       " 'Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.',\n",
       " 'Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed.',\n",
       " 'Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA.',\n",
       " 'I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame.',\n",
       " \"We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times.\",\n",
       " 'My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.',\n",
       " \"It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible.\",\n",

I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service.\",\n",

It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!\",\n",
       " \"I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.\",\n",
       " 'Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated.',\n",
       " 'British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.',\n",

For me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. I was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. Landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. Not BA's finest hour.\",\n",

Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. Overall it was an OK experience with a great cabin crew.',\n",

Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become.',\n",

Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. Overall, a flight that was typical of the post-COVID standard for short-haul business class.\",\n",

We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. They commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogether. The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.  Complained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual \"we fell short of our standards\" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios to compensate for the lack of service.',\n",

Some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. But the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch.

However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service. Breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach.

Brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer.

Post-COVID lunch remains restricted - Do&Co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish I've ever tasted.

I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says \"therefore we can\\'t answer your call; try again.\" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I\\'ve now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor\\'s note saying that I was sick, then they\\'ll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.',\n",

Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience.',\n",

British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around.',\n",

Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. I was stunned by the recent cancellation to my Catania flight two weeks before I was due to travel.',\n",

After flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life! I tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time I didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff.',\n",

Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.',\n",

I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me. On top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and I had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder. I met no one whom I can ask for a help. First British airways representative I met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that I have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases.

So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.',\n",

I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA\\'s universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm\\'s length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn\\'t available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The \"bed\" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I\\'ve ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines!

He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them.

The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense.

After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it.

I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft.

Fast track security was fast, as expected. Galleries Club Lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. Boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. The crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight. The food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering. I found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11\" chap. So overall a good experience with no major complaints.',\n",
       " 'I was to fly to Melbourne from Manchester via London and Singapore in July 2019. Arriving late to board my Heathrow flight, the Check-In-Staff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor. Only option being to find my way to Heathrow. I somehow managed to get to Heathrow in time where only the Singapore to Melbourne Boarding Pass was issued. I was told that because Manchester to Heathrow flight was missed, my Heathrow to Singapore was cancelled.',\n",
       " \"Madrid to London. I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don't waste your money on this.\",\n",
       " 'Prague to London. This is the first time I have flown with British Airways. The flight departed earlier than intended and got to Heathrow about 5 minutes early. However at Heathrow, there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. A negative was at the check-in, partly the website’s fault, as we had done the online check in. We selected the amount of bags we each had. It said we would have to pay extra, and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each bag. Apart from those negatives and the delay, I would definitely fly this airline again.',\n",
       " \"Johannesburg to London. Whoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card.\",\n",
       " \"Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.\",\n",
       " 'San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.',\n",
       " \"On 4th of December before my flight's departure I got my purse stolen in NYC with all my money and my passport in it. Thanks to the kind strangers I managed to get to the Danish embassy and get a temporary passport. When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. When I finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as I haven't had any food for the whole day as I didn't have any money. I want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that I got back to Denmark safely. I was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff! Once again thank you!\",\n",
       " \"Phoenix to London. Since moving to the USA I've been flying BA more than in the past and overall, they provide a more than acceptable service. If you choose your seat in Club World carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations. The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. On this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good. Departed PHX early and arrived into LHR early where immigration and baggage took minutes. If you manage your expectations with BA, then you won't be disappointed with Club World.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Bangkok. Done this route a few times with British Airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment system. Uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight. I know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away. The only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy.',\n",
       " \"Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern. British Airways needs to improve their ground experience.\",\n",
       " 'I purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and I to travel from Orlando, Florida to Accra, Ghana and I purchased advance seat assignments. Unfortunately, British Airways only gave me the seats I paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip. I have been fighting with British Airways to get my refund for these seat assignments. They have only provided me with refund of $234. Despite several phone calls and filing multiple on-line calls and providing them with detailed, my fightcontinues. Their customer service is really poor. I will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again.',\n",
       " 'Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31\". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific\\'s is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I\\'d fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.',\n",
       " 'Hong Kong to London Heathrow with British Airways. One of the best flights I’ve had in a premium cabin. The service, seat, food and wine are among the best I’ve experienced.

The cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch. I would not hesitate flying First class with BA on my next flight.',\n",

       " 'Singapore to Paris via London. The flight was a ok, dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience. However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage.',\n",
       " \"Warsaw to London. Everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight. Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.\",\n",
       " \"London to Bangkok. It's not what it used to be but most importantly, it does not deliver what it promises any longer.  Disappointing food, outdated and uncomfortable seats, appalling baggage handling at LHR, and  mediocre crew service onboard. The customer service online is just as bad. My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. However, my dealings with customer service was appalling. When is BA going to offer a kids free zone in Club World for people who need to work or sleep?\",\n",
       " 'Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.  BA  need to refurbish their old cabins on Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747,if they still plan to use them on longer flights.',\n",

I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment I’d have given this flight 10/10! A fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline.',\n",

I settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. Crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately.

       " 'Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos. They offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.',\n",

The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing. As 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be it. Terrible customer service.\",\n",

When I got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and I can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly.

       " \"Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately BA hasn\\'t done much work on their first class on these aircraft. Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6\\'1\" makes the beds small. And since it\\'s so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful. Meals are impeccable.',\n",

       " 'London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA\\'s 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service \"business class\"? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again.',\n",
       " \"The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.\",\n",
       " 'Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go. I hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight.',\n",

To have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult.

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. On other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings.',\n",

They pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. You awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze. My seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways). Would not and could not recommended this airline.

Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline.',\n",

       " 'London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul.',\n",
       " 'The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a \"mix up\" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a \"mix up\" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline.',\n",

Not a great Club Europe experience.',\n",
       " 'Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so.',\n",

I'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. It's not worth it.\",\n",

BA refunded my fare soon enough, but I am still awaiting a refund for the 70 Euro cost of baggage that I paid - six weeks later. I lodged a complaint on 9th October. No action.

On-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. Easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, I have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on.

       " 'London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update! In summary, don’t trust BA with your loved ones care.',\n",
       " 'London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.',\n",

Flight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in. The back of the seat in front was dirty. The tray on the 12D where I was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the TV screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch. Although my husband in 12E and me turned in the breakfast cards together, the flight attendant insisted they don’t have it, and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast.  Flight attendants were doing their best, but it seems that they were understaffed.',\n",

       " 'Flew back from Abu Dhabi in World traveller plus. The seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort, I got no sleep. A snack was served after take off which was quite tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tasteless. Not much interaction with the crew, but they seemed friendly enough. Would not travel with British Airways in this cabin again, really not worth the price tag.',\n",
       " 'Johannesburg to Amsterdam via London. After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. The following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same \"technical\" fault reported 24 hours previously. Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our \"no show\" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.',\n",
       " 'Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new \"business suite\" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don\\'t know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.',\n",

When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service.',\n",

A praise is due and I want to congratulate BA for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed, the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content, the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler.

Would I choose BA premium Eco again : Yes Definitely.',\n",

The seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent, plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket. Very enjoyable flight. Highly recommended.',\n",

We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockers. But plenty of spare lockers and our iPads took are of that.',\n",
       " \"The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.\",\n",
       " \"Glasgow to London. Smooth flight, departure/arrival on time. Boarding was quick, the seat was ok. Although I had pre-ordered a vegetarian option, the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. The food was good, and the wine (french, Bourgogne) also surprisingly good. Flight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detail. All in all, a great flight.\",\n",
       " \"Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.\",\n",

Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off!

       " 'London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.',\n",

Arriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??). We had to wait ages for BA to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the Qantas lounge. A broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him. A ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight. Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. The night term pantry offering was a total joke. I have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service level. Certainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home.',\n",

Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos - and had to be flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour delay. Flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight. The crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane - they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat. Flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled. Breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow. Full credit to the crew - cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc. The aircraft was clean but old and down at heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the \"floor\" was visible.',\n",

The Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy with limited seats available. Boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift. The inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner.

Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320-232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew.

The children’s meals were excellent. The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?).

The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed.\",\n",

The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.',\n",

My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.\",\n",

Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight.\",\n",

AA verified that they delivered the bags to BA but they were not on our flight when we reached London. The bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bags. I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing. On the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock. With an experience like this on our first vacation to London, I would do everything to never fly British Airways again.',\n",

Many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected us badly. No response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged',\n",

Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now I’m hoping against hope I might make it home today, 3 days after setting off!',\n",
       " 'A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.',\n",
       " \"London to Nice. I agree totally with the comments made in Michael Croft's review today. My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses. Not just the CEO should go, but some others at the top.\",\n",
       " 'Palma to London Heathrow. How does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management? These issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll, preferably from the CEO down. Just read a fatuously stupid interview with Alex Cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel, when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019 - let alone try to make himself look all eco-friendly with such comments. I have been a loyal customer for over 48 years, and it seems that BA have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of BA without complaint until now. My patience has run out.',\n",

Only chicken was our option to have. Very sad and staff did not care about this situation.',\n",

Then I had to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours. There was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us. Now it was 3am with no one to speak too and I still don't have my bags. I had to grab a taxi to sleep (BA didn't not provide a hotel stay).

There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation.

Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.',\n",

When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack!

       " \"Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.\",\n",
       " \"Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.\",\n",

Soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights.

I was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, I showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate.

The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks.',\n",

They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!\",\n",
       " 'Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. But that really shouldn’t happen.

(See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class.

Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable.

I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing.',\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to New York. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience, refreshing to see these days. The quality of food and drinks was wonderful. There was plenty of leg room as well. We would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations. On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. She came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! To say I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and you certainly made it something special!',\n",
       " 'Gatwick to Bermuda. Boarded very quickly and on time, Seating area smart, appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up. Service very good, food was the best I have had from BA, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdue. Duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the Pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British Airways. Thank you I am looking forward to my Seychelles flight in October and my Rio flight in December, keep it coming.',\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Larnaca. Perfect. The early morning departure meant that Terminal 5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.',\n",
       " 'BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA. Perhaps standards at LGW are not as good as at LHR.',\n",
       " \"Heathrow to Kalamata. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA's so all in all decent flights. Haven't used BA for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right.\",\n",

Thinking it must have been some kind of joke, I noted with the British Airways representatives saying that I was on time. She replied yes but you were the last person, everyone had made it before me, my bags were already offloaded she continued to say.  After asking what do I do now? Not having the ability to ring abroad I asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no Qantas office in Amsterdam and they cannot help me.',\n",

My first flight in Economy is the new A321 Neo, The aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats.

I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music. Our return flight from KL to London was very cold, the Boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat.',\n",

Crew was fine, entertainment system on the London to New York leg was very nice. The special meal I ordered was not on either of the two flights. I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. I submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses I received were lame and unacceptable. Not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500).\",\n",
       " 'Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn\\'t an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we\\'re used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta\\'s. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the \"tea\" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.',\n",

       " 'London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. British Airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. This is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow.',\n",

The check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The “welcome” sign displayed at the BA desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. To cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!',\n",

I was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which I did and given a number to call the next day. The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours before I left Madrid. So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that I needed whilst there.',\n",

I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom.

I was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out.

Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved.',\n",

It was irritating because one of us was ill.',\n",
       " \"London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.\",\n",
       " 'The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.',\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls.',\n",
       " \"CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.\",\n",
       " 'Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again.',\n",
       " 'Lima to Gatwick. Helpful and courteous cabin crew.  The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. The screen was small and in poor condition. Movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor. The touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset. A 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system.',\n",
       " 'Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights.',\n",
       " 'I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight.',\n",

       " \"Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor.\",\n",

I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.',\n",

       " 'Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.',\n",
       " 'Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.',\n",
       " \"London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.\",\n",
       " \"This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this.

Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. I was not happy because I had the permitted allowance.',\n",

The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats.

       " \"Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.\",\n",

The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough.',\n",

We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it\\'s now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking.

No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it.

       " \"Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.\",\n",

The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.',\n",

Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act. I certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future.',\n",

Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough.

Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful.',\n",

When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly.',\n",

Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.',\n",

Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?',\n",
       " 'St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.',\n",

Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this.',\n",

Heathrow T5 the usual chaos. I can use the F Lounge due to my One World status. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Toilets filthy. One of the worst lounges I’ve seen. Boarding orderly and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE screen broken. Seats very uncomfortable and narrow. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful.

This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class.',\n",

The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag.

The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again.',\n",
       " \"Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.\",\n",
       " 'Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, \"we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us\". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a \"balance problem\". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me.',\n",
       " 'Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the \"turn right\" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service.',\n",

I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation.

Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.\",\n",
       " \"It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman\\'s lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that\\'s the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I\\'d make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6\" of leg room behind row \"1\". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i\\'d probably sell it at £25 a flight more. \"Build value guys\" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.',\n",
       " 'Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.',\n",

On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return.

       " 'Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5\\'2\" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on.

Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out.

       " \"Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers.\",\n",
       " \"London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment.\",\n",

She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained.',\n",

Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand.',\n",

The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.\",\n",

From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later.

However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes.

       " 'My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option.',\n",

Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority.

       " 'I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.',\n",

We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.\",\n",

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably.

Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand.

The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

I had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn't work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'I'll put it in the book'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. My wife's entertainment screen, didn't work, the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently. It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I'm glad I didn't. My frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too.\",\n",
       " 'Kuala Lumpur to Miami via London in business class with British Airways. The business class seats were small for business class and pretty old. The flight entertainment system are outdated. I am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection. Food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class. Overall BA have to do better to be on top of their game. Planes has to be changed.',\n",

A week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared, and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating. I decided no BA anymore.

The last flight I took BA to use my Avios points and I literally flew free, but never to use BA again.',\n",

But the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I enjoyed the flight. The seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. Like how the taxi from Polderban is almost as long as the flight itself.',\n",
       " \"Antigua to Gatwick. Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. Tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. When asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue.\",\n",
       " 'I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15\". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must\\'ve been. And of course you only get compensation by patronising them again. Now I know: ever a free ticket on BOAC is overpriced.',\n",

The service is non-existent, unless they are serving you the meal. If you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member, they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. The toilets are dirty and basic. I’m a Gold Member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines. They’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap.',\n",

Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. Not my best flight.',\n",

The pre take off drink was water or orange juice.  Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. Wine selection was very American with jug wines. The movie selection was OK. The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. The 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies.',\n",

Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. Insufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy.\",\n",

My flight from Barcelona to London was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections. When I finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly. It took me nearly 24 hours to travel from Barcelona to JFK.  When I arrived, my luggage wasn't there so I filed a claim. I called and emailed every day and they couldn't find it even though I had a tag number and and documentation.

So I approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. They instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation.

       " \"Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.\",\n",
       " 'London to Berlin scheduled for 21st December. On approach to the airport, I got a message saying that my flight was canceled. No explanation was given. As I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. Eurostar). My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).',\n",

This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects of BA's service in the past, I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.\",\n",

Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class.',\n",

I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic.

The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew.

I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight.

       " 'Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I\\'d guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the \"new\" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It\\'s probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being \"an up market business class\" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you\\'d expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the \"cheap\" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the \"superb\" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world\\'s most hated Business Class in the sky. I\\'m a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.',\n",

I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. If you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.',\n",
       " \"Glasgow to New York via London. Morning flight from GLA to LHR was ok. I really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFK. On the JFK flight the service was fantastic. The meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. We left and arrived on time. The seat and legroom was fine. My mothers IFE didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. The cabin crew were very friendly.\",\n",
       " 'Sydney to London via Singapore. I\\'m hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you\\'re interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you\\'re next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The \"new releases\" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. I would not recommend BA to anyone.',\n",
       " 'Johannesburg to London. In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. The cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight.',\n",
       " \"Antigua to Gatwick. One of the worst business class experience. Entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. Food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. Nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. Woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt.\",\n",
       " \"Gatwick to Barbados. First class was third rate. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. Poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. I have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember why. Avoid them if your route allows.\",\n",
       " \"Cape Town to London. Very unimpressive amenities and service. Unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course. I finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.\",\n",
       " \"Bucharest to London. They are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haul. In Bucharest they did not park at the terminal, they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus. They are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. Avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to. I have no problem with BA turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we're being scammed.\",\n",
       " 'Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City via London. The journey from Malaysia to Mexico alone for business trip would be very boring. However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on food. They are polite and talk to me with big smiles. So, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them again. Hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip.',\n",
       " 'Miami to London. BA are going downhill . Having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey, the choice was exactly the same this time.  I explained to the steward that I didn’t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but I was told by an extremely rude steward that I could like it or lump it basically. He said I should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  The snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. Totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. The light didn’t work on my seat so I couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my TV, watching was incredibly hard. Entertainment having travelled four times in last month, films have barely changed. I won’t be travelling with them again if at all possible.',\n",
       " 'I would like to compliment British Airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food served.

       " \"Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. This airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements BA's transformation into an overpriced EasyJet. Will not fly with them again.\",\n",
       " 'We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girl. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future.',\n",
       " 'Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days. All in all a very enjoyable flight.',\n",

Just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.',\n",

The staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British, and I’ll certainly not be recommending!',\n",
       " \"San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult. The bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.',\n",
       " \"London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.\",\n",
       " 'Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. I rejected BA\\'s offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. When I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to sit separately. At the booking in I was told that they could not find \"proof\" that I had paid for selected seats. I could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. Spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I planned. On the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my TV did not work. The staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat. On return, BA customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. Despite sending two detailed messages, I received the same response. Completely inadequate service by BA (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights I paid for and dealing with the complaints.',\n",
       " \"Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. All the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, I'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.\",\n",
       " \"Boston to Nairobi via London. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew service was below standard. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movie. I  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungry. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. It looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB port. Cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. I'm probably to blame because I overrated BA before flying with them but now I know better.\",\n",
       " \"Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I'm off to the US I will look for an alternative airline.\",\n",

Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. Then the customer service has been very useless. Such a very bad experience. I do not recommend flying with them.',\n",

After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag.',\n",
       " \"I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. Don't bother flying BA.\",\n",

Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.',\n",

The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious.

While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers.',\n",

Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional.

First days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials. Flight home from LHR-YYZ was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn't stay upright.

The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. I don't expect top food in a plane but I expect service. If you announce things, make sure you have them. On some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  You must eat when they order you to eat. They seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon's. You have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner.

There are 8 Club World seats per row for 777-300ER, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as good as expected.

The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today's business market.\",\n",
       " \"Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. I now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where.\",\n",
       " 'London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice.',\n",

       " 'London - Pisa (Return). I fly this route often as we have a house in Tuscany. This, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. Outbound we went through the \"First\" wing check in at T5. (We are Gold card members). The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom. BA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business class. The product is only worth it in a Sale or Avious points. The every day fare price is ludicrous.',\n",
       " \"I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never fly British Airways again.\",\n",
       " 'BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.',\n",

       " \"Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.\",\n",
       " 'Chicago to London. I have flown long haul many times with both BA and Virgin premium economy. In my view whilst the Virgin product has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly better. Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. For the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off. Plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg.',\n",
       " 'Berlin to London. It was a connecting flight, so I should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine clean and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffee. While this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers. BA simply turned into a low cost airline.',\n",
       " 'British Airways is my favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The staff was professional. Food was above expectation. During 7 hours flight staff is always there. Captain kept updating us about weather, turbulence, and time.',\n",
       " \"Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to New York JFK. The First Wing at Terminal 5 was rubbish tonight, 20 or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of BA’s ground operation. Flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at Kennedy made us overall late. Staff very cheerful. This route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the Indian chicken was very bland.',\n",
       " 'Heraklion to Gatwick. Left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake. 30 mins after I realised I went back to the airport but no British Airways staff was willing to help. Asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar. Dialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again. This is so frustrating.',\n",
       " \"Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere. The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience. Food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks. I'll be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Brindisi. We weren’t expecting the long queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5. Galleries South lounge was also teeming, but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food. Group boarding was handled efficiently. The A321 was relatively new and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children. Despite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink service was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offering. It’s hard to see the point of BA’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate.',\n",
       " \"I have BA silver membership. This promises fast track, choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge access. I would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst. The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat. The Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast. British Airways is a rip off. I have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom. I recently travelled on Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal BA/Iberia are by comparison.\",\n",

Check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it. All in all an unsatisfactory airline.\",\n",

I got an emergency seat assigned at the online check-in, though these are usually for extra money.

I did not purchase any food, but I saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on-board purchases.',\n",

Forward Business Class cabin on 787 is fairly private. Service on both flights was flawless, very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals. Food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic. Outstanding crew on BA 603 and BA 99 - on our outgoing flights from Toronto on August 16 similar great service. BA gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience. Their seating arrangement in Club World is perfect when travelling with family. Other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone.',\n",

The planes are filthy, not cleaned properly between flights, the staff are hit and miss - but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out. The food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable - and as for customer service, there is no point in ringing them they are useless, rude, hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever.',\n",

I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fast. There is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free WIFI. We boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. BA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hate. However I thought the pricing was ok.',\n",

Thankfully BA airline staff are always the best.',\n",
       " \"London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA in European flights distinct? Probably nothing.\",\n",
       " 'London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice. They really made this already special experience even more special. If you want to treat yourself to BA First, I would thoroughly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'Philadelphia to London. Nice plane, nice seats, low quality service on the plane. Both my husband and I ordered low sodium meals. His was delivered, mine was not. When asked, the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray LSML. Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal. Before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew. I thought British Airways was better than this.',\n",

One air vent for the 3-seat row and no in-seat power. Luggage was mislaid for 33 hours, even with priority tag.

However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!',\n",
       " 'San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flight. Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class \"scramble over the legs\" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today\\'s competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. Much more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of \"blockbuster\" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA\\'s - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat. If Virgin Atlantic fly the same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don\\'t have to pay to pre-reserve your seat.',\n",
       " 'London to Dublin. This was an early morning departure from Heathrow on a full flight. BA managed everything in a very professional manner. The bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules. The cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video. During this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression. I had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.',\n",

       " \"This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.\",\n",
       " 'Amman to London. Appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called \\'vegan meal\\' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said \"oh I don\\'t think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk\". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said \\'We don\\'t provide that sort of thing.\" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.',\n",
       " \"Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking.\",\n",
       " \"Gatwick to Paphos in Club Europe. We travelled on the first Saturday of the school holidays and whilst Gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad. We expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. The flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass. The meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried out. Flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Very happy with the service.\",\n",
       " 'New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game \"pong\" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges to select Business Class seats. For my family of 4, it would have cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments.',\n",
       " 'Istanbul to London Heathrow. The plane itself was old, I found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be checked in for security purposes. This meant that when I was at Ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks. 1 before check in, one after check in and one before getting on the plane. Because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane. Norwegian offers free wifi so I could check my phone on the plane. British Airways need to improve their service levels.',\n",
       " 'Bad service and attitude all round. My fiasco was when my flight from London was cancelled due to failure of their systems. BA refused to rebook us at the airport, instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to Milan via Madrid a day later. BA are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel, food and refreshment costs.  We were stranded at the airport, no help to find a hotel, zero customer care or empathy. Premium prices for a Ryanair style service.',\n",
       " \"London to Santiago de Chile. I was flying premium economy with BA and surprised that I got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. The seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. However, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). The frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. I didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).  I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average). Premium economy is a good value for money, especially on a 15 hrs flight.\",\n",
       " 'Flew a now ageing B777 flight BA 0053 to Seattle. Pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. OK choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of Prosecco when boarded. Comfortable seat BUT it\\'s the old bug bear - 8 across with \"over the legs\" access to the aisle. Fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. And we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. I know BA are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in Club Class but this can\\'t come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a Premium Product in the present circumstances, is it? Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although it was On Demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... FA\\'s great welcoming and gave good service. But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  Not what I expect from a flag carrier airline. We refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. So, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.',\n",
       " 'Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. So overall, it’s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.',\n",

       " 'London to Amsterdam. BA\\'s service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight\\'s experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA\\'s ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because \"all the rooms were full\". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised \"rebooking\" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA\\'s app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I\\'ll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the \"we don\\'t work for BA excuse\". I\\'ve had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn\\'t have handled it better. By contrast, I don\\'t see how BA could have handled this worse. They really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.',\n",

You get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention. They walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact. No bags at the other end on arrival which I guess you have to live with, however the way they deal with it is appalling. Couldn't care less I feel. 3hr delay on return flights.

I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow.

       " 'Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it. Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly.',\n",
       " 'Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.',\n",

No smile, no 'Hello' or 'Good morning'. Hardly any eye contact either. If anything, the situation was worse at boarding. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. All such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.\",\n",

The check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly. He was professional and pleasant and very efficient too. The flight was on an A320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too. The cabin crew were welcoming and orderly.

Not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from BA. British Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, like others I have found an alternative airline.

Upon arrival in Shanghai I was not the only one from BA169 reporting missing luggage. Mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use. Nothing was missing, so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage? People deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state. BA have not provided any explanation despite queries to Customer Relations; this is not acceptable.

I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline. British Airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty - it’s about time they  had a deep clean and re-model the first class it’s getting so old, it’s like club class with a few tweaks.',\n",
       " 'Had four flights in total with this airline, first flight from Dublin to London on 29th June 2018 was delayed by 2 hours. This delay would have meant we missed our connection in Heathrow to Miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies). We arrived in Miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. By the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. Our flights home to Dublin via Heathrow were fine until we reached Dublin and realised they had lost our bag. Despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience). We are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out. Seems like no one cares. This was our first and last experience of using BA.',\n",

Their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but I was charged £65 to bring my bike back. The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt. As I had to bring the bike back, I had no choice but to pay. When I got back I contacted their customer service, they are not willing to help.  Also, the seats are getting really uncomfortable. The food is terrible.',\n",

Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with. Group boarding was super slow. Inside the econ cabin, the plane seemed very old, and worn-out. The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. Some of the flight attendants were unprofessional. Meals were bad for me, the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good. They gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight. The wifi doesn't exist in the cabin.\",\n",

No co-ordination at airport and apparently not one BA manager at Rome airport who I could speak to. Had to call BA customer service in UK which was a waste of time. Given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. Failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. Advised stewardess but they did not care. Could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. Waste of time paying to go business class with BA.  They did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way.',\n",
       " \"Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip.\",\n",
       " \"Mumbai to London Heathrow. Disappointing experience. I wouldn't book business class again, felt like bad value for money. I've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. I had one person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested. The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money. I paid an extra £500+ for better food on a tray with cutlery. Really not worth it!\",\n",
       " \"Delhi to London. Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. Those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably. They more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking.\",\n",
       " \"When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staff. Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. She spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. Because I need special assistance they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines. The food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice. In my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don't have snobs working for them.\",\n",
       " 'British Airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to Gibraltar was faultless.

Gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge.',\n",
       " \"BA First Class is not even that any more. Starting with the lounge in T3; this may be an offshoot of the fine Concorde Room in T5, but it need not feel like a rural train station. Poor food, average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUC. There is no ground assistance, and boarding was haphazard. Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods, and not close to the Emirate's suites. Small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). The crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery, but poor overall. BA, your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you, and your First Class product is not worth the name anymore. One can only assume that BA are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product. And no wi-fi\",\n",
       " 'Linate to London. The morning of the departure I received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled, with no specified reason. As an alternative They rerouted me on a night flight to Madrid, then to Palma, to arrive the next day in Birmingham. Disappointed of the disservice I called the customer service in England (and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator) and I was offered a flight in the evening at 1900, which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined. I had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to London in time, unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune. On top of it, since the flight would arrive no longer at Heathrow but at Stansted, I had to pay the taxi £70 more than the agreed amount if I arrived at Heathrow. British Airways did not take responsibility, I was not reimbursed the new flight I had to book last minute nor the taxi difference. They did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused. The worst has been the answer of their customer Care saying it was not their responsibility!',\n",

We had to wait for a store to open to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste. Horrible, horrible service. Then we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at 4.30 pm yesterday. It’s almost 1 pm the next day and the bag still isn’t here!',\n",
       " 'I have flown British Airways numerous times over many years. Sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. We asked for the fish. After some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. Eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. We were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. We were not given anything. The service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. BA will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.',\n",
       " \"We can not fault the new 'Club World' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. It's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. Really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. You now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get. The pillow is larger and tons better than before. Can't believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in Seattle and once home again. We do mainly Club Europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new Club World will be a great success.\",\n",

Loaded aircraft ready for push back, no a/c Temperature was excessively hot all flight, no cool air. Personal Media system broken, split screen. Food quality diabolical. Moody flight attendants, ran out of hand soap. Return flight on A380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flight. Been flying BA for over 25 years, probably would be a last choice in future - sad to see.',\n",

Evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. Menu listed seasonal salad (leaf, one small piece of lettuce and cucumber), braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta, with butter pecan cake. Only 3 beef meals available. Choice was either pasta or to go hungry. I chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice. Breakfast (a light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted of a cream cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later. We paid extra for World Traveller Plus but I consider that we were conned. Customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing I received the following response, \"Thanks for coming back to us. I completely understand why you’re disappointed we couldn’t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flight. I hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering. This meant they couldn’t provide a full meal service and I absolutely agree this isn’t what you would expect when you travel with us. I’m sorry we’ve let you down.\" That is it. Thank you BA.

But if I have to be realistic, it’s very old, loud and uncomfortable. The service isn’t good either, you don’t even get a cup of water. It’s great to hop to London, but don’t expect any kind of special treatment or service.',\n",
       " 'Glasgow to New York JFK via London. Outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747. Still I could see its age. We had a duo seat at the back of the plane. The plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head. The IFE was decent and had a good selection. The cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us. Flight left close to on time. Service was quick as we were first served at the back. We were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. Adequate amount of food served and was tasty. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. We then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. It was ok. Return flight from Vegas was on a old 747. Horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. Service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. Small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. IFE was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice. I wouldnt fly BA again if I had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats. £210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive. Also the planes they use are too old and tatty.',\n",
       " 'Flew on a last minute emergency trip London Heathrow to Baltimore with BA. Most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new Boeing 787. I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747. BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation. This felt to me more like being crammed in to a Boeing 737 on a transatlantic flight.',\n",
       " \"Earlier this year, my wife and I travelled business class with BA from Dublin to Jo'burg, returning from Cape Town, thru London in each direction. Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA. Having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly, we have discovered how much behind the play BA actually are.\",\n",
       " \"BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule. Overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. British Airways are falling ever behind their competitors.\",\n",

       " \"I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!!\",\n",

Terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism, they offered £25 voucher and no apology - an insult as did not ask for compensation.

       " \"This is the first time I have flown BA's Club Europe flying from London Heathrow to Corfu. I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again. I paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which I think was very good value for what I had.\",\n",
       " 'Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. I consider this to be completely unacceptable. If this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with them. The budget airlines can do better at lower cost.',\n",

The flight attendant who served the section where I was seated couldn't have cared less. No greetings when passengers boarded the plane, no offer of help. He asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink. No second drink was offered. The toilet hadn't been cleaned properly before boarding, and during the flight, one of the two washrooms became unusable, resulting in long queues. The seating arrangement - having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction- is uncomfortable. Overall, appalling quality and little value for money.\",\n",
       " \"Washington to Bucharest return via London. I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. The two London-Bucharest sectors both went well. But all this was just a prelude to my return trip. While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. On arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another Club World upgrade (this time for free). Once on the plane back to Washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how I was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items I really can't eat but ultimately I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive a crew as I've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. What could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I've had mostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that's a big reason why I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so. But a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you're the best.\",\n",

The seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2-hour flight.  You can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever someone is moving. I didn't buy any food or drink onboard, although I reckon it's not badly priced. The inbound flight was on an older A320, in which the seat was reclining.\",\n",
       " \"London to Istanbul. Due to poor weather conditions at LHR, the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable. When the passengers were informed of the gate, everyone gathered at the 'A' gate in T5. Then, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own. Next, there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a C gate. Everyone rushes to the one of the last of the 'C' gates. Once on board, the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour. The flight finally takes off nearly three hours late. After a while, the crew comes with the M&S gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and I had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner. The flight arrived in Istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury, the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal.\",\n",
       " \"London to Cape Town. Flying first class with British Airways is a hit-or-miss affair. But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. However, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes. Overall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.\",\n",
       " 'London to Hamburg. Typically if I fly BA it is SFO or LAX to LHR. This time I flew them from Miami via Tampa thru LHR to Hamburg. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. All the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium lounge. The BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. People jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. Boarding was like a cattle call. BA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in first. The seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. The service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of California. The flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. Rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what I did for my connection to Hamburg. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. Their Avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines. Try using BA points on American or Cathay or even Alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.',\n",
       " 'Turin to London Gatwick. Rubbish check-in service, as bad as Ryanair. I show the staff my mobile boarding pass, checked website that I have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance. One bag was over 23 kg (27/28), they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me I will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in. They were so rude and unhelpful. Boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner. Flight was delayed without the checked-in agent saying anything, after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather. At the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait.',\n",

They texted asking for the hand luggage to be checked in as the flight was busy. I did and they lost it. 7 hours later no luggage or idea where it is. No compensation - only after 12 hours and for a small amount. Ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will. Lagging significantly behind EasyJet in all aspects.',\n",
       " 'Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Desperately poor service from British Airways in Club Class. Business Class is utterly outdated, with the weird \"facing each-other configuration\", and narrow / uncomfortable seats. The food served was appalling. The cabin crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. The problem with British Airways now in First and Business Class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoever. Poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, No WIFI and an overall budget airline experience. British Airways even charge for seat selection too, which adds insult to injury. Avoid this horrible airline if you can. The only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful, quiet Airbus A380. A shame BA ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude.',\n",
       " \"London Heathrow to Mahon. Booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to Madrid on the 26th May” when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). Raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. Separate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. Conclusion is families avoid at all costs.\",\n",

World Traveller passengers have the option to pre-order from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of LHR with prices ranging from £15 to £18. I had the Gourmet Dining consisting of braised Hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious. If you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul BA flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route, I highly recommend you to go for it.',\n",

Not to mention the Boeing 757 looked ancient, for a 6 hour flight from Paris I expected a little more. The flight attendants did not keep us updated. Lastly after we got off the plane they had one  receptionist at the desk to deal with the 60+ people who needed to rebook flights and get hotels for the night. Will never fly British airways again. Delta forever.',\n",
       " \"I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again.\",\n",
       " \"Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again.\",\n",
       " 'Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.',\n",
       " \"Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago.\",\n",

There was no machine to print a card, queue taking 75 minutes to get boarding card, and several people were too late for check in. There were 4 desks 2 for priority, 2 for general check in for all flights. Only 1 desk served, once they were about to close check in',\n",

The departure was from Terminal 1 in Munich, which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2. And arrival at Terminal 5 in Heathrow which is not as nice/easy as the new Star alliance Queens Terminal 2. No WiFi, personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flight. Seat reservation too expensive in my eyes. British airways has one big advantage though: the generous hand luggage rules.',\n",

       " 'Washington to Prague via London. I have flown them several times in the past, but not for a number of years. I remember them as not a \"top of the line\" airline, but better than average. This time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airline. You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very cramped. It is said to be 31\" but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new \"slimline\" seats, I\\'m not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. The agent at Washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. It was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. I won\\'t say that I will not fly them again, but I will definitely compare prices in the future. They aren\\'t worth any extra cost.',\n",
       " 'London to Washington. Apart from the space, nothing nothing was First class, not even the comfort. Crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach. Food which used to be fantastic is just eatable, no more. Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson made the selection (apart from a good white champagne, but mediocre rosé) are at the level of a business class. And my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. Needless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airline. Sad for the clients and shameful for BA management.',\n",

Even with mobility assistance and a fast track card and 80 minutes between flights, it was a close call to make connections.',\n",
       " 'London to Montreal. I did my online check-in the night before and left to go to the airport. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn\\'t working, so I proceeded to the BA counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. I was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. The line we were moved to was substantially longer however I was patient. By the time I got to the desk, an hour had passed, and I had a bit over an hour left to my flight. I figured this was tight but all the while manageable since I trusted BA\\'s system. The woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said \"you won\\'t make it\". I explained the situation how I had been in the airport for several hours already and that I was in line for 1 hour. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  I had no choice but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed. Imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500 CAD all in. When I escalated my complaint, they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you, and that was that.',\n",
       " \"Tokyo to Amsterdam via London. On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it's much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. I didn't like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats, there's also the IFE box so there's no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR.  Luckily I've made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. There's nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice. Unfortunately BA decided to cut the the service on European flights in the race to the bottom.\",\n",
       " 'Check-in at Vienna Airport was painless. BA uses Air Lounge at Vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay. Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to Club Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. I found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches. One passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Business class was quite average to be honest. Will fly Club Europe again maybe depending on which route and price. BA has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within Europe.',\n",

Flying out at 0720 on a Sunday and having an early start to get to the airport I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. Having never usually been a problem, I boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket, to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business. Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep – another example of BA’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna – quite as to how, is beyond me. I'll be sticking to easyJet until British Airways once again starts to value it’s passengers, as currently they couldn’t care less.\",\n",

The poorest part of the trip is the TV being so small and picture so poor.

Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey. For dinner there was butter chicken, rice and lentils, and a rice pudding type desert, all of which was okay - nothing special.\",\n",

On the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats, there was no waste envelope, whilst my inflight magazine was so overused. LHR to PHL an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way, rather poor lunch. I was disappointed with BA especially with their decision to charge for F&B on European flights.',\n",

The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough. Drinks selection was very good. Plus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humour. Understand BA plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough.',\n",

Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive. I am enrolled in and pay for TSA Pre Check and if British Airways would participate in this program, it would save a lot of angst. Other than that, the overall BA experience was totally acceptable.',\n",

The touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working. The washroom had a leak and when I used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks, the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said I shouldn’t have worn socks.

I have had several replies in that time but on each occasion, the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in Venice.

My flight from Singapore was delayed in the air and I was not allowed onto my connecting flight. British Airways re-booked me on the next flight, but downgraded me from Business to Economy and into a centre seat. Fine, I wanted to get home and they said they would compensate me. After 3 weeks, they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket, but I was not entitled to any even token gesture of Frequent Flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat, after a long haul flight. I missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep. It was all handled very poorly, late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via Air France or one of the middle east carriers who value my business. Its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and I will certainly look at flying with other carriers now.',\n",

No drinks or food served on the flight, the check-in process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well. A bit more legroom but that won’t justify the £200 price difference on a 2hr flight.',\n",

Only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced, which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier. Probably the worst business class seat around, wobbly footrest, facing strangers and having to climb over people. Breakfast was a single, meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup. At disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers, that was left to other passengers. Crew just stood there. Economy was not held back, so no priority disembarkation. Never again.',\n",

       " 'London to Moscow. British Airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in Business class is no longer Club World (flat bed) seat but Club Europe seat (not flat bed). It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. I cannot fly during the day as I have meetings scheduled. BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. Moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. In Summary it is unacceptable that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change. This was never the case before and BA was fair previously.',\n",

On my most recent flight from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400. Which to me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service, from the MIA ground handling American crew. Food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29E generous for my long legs. I recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight. Well done BA you excel against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service.',\n",

The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star. It's not even worth redeeming Avios points anymore. These days I'd rather spend my Avios on partner airlines.\",\n",

I then went to the Galleries Lounge (south), and although I have not been there for a year or two, it looked the same. Same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. My gate was just around the corner, and I got on the plane. I like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. The food service was disappointing. The service in the cabin was OK, but not very warm. I have travelled a lot with BA over the past 20 years, after yesterda I have lost my faith in British Airways.',\n",
       " 'BA used to be a byword for quality and service. You simply can’t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. I paid 600 dollars for my ticket from Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flight. Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but at far lower prices. It seems to be the same all over. BA used to be a first choice but at this price, for this service, it’s become a last resort.',\n",
       " 'Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience.',\n",

Seriously, if you can find an alternative to travel within the UK do it. Not very countable if you have a connected flight!',\n",

I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. The BA website would not let me do so. The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. Disembarkation was slow and badly managed. Nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers. BA has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again in a hurry.',\n",

BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA.\",\n",

On getting to Virgin Atlantic counter, we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from BA, we decided to do that. I opened a case on BA website, explaining what happened and requested for a refund, as what happened was their fault and not mine. They refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy, I know this, but what happened was not my fault, but theirs.

Generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it\\'s more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says \"I\\'m sorry but the space is needed for large bags\", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean \"thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we\\'ll take away your leg room\". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.',\n",

I wish that food would be more taste neutral. If your child doesn’t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would be nothing to eat. The stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding. Landing was smooth. The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on. There are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in, and these boxes are very small. Also the Airport Security was overly zealous - they had to search kids bag, and they found roll-on deodorant and checked it for fumes.',\n",

They will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used. I raised this with BA who refused to offer like-for-like replacement. I got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later I decide that something is better than nothing and call K2, to get the bag they offered me, only to find that BA have closed my case and they won't send one. Finally get through to BA and they finally agree to put me back to K2 to get the bag offered. If I want to upgrade what they offer I will have to pay it myself.

Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure time made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. Efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. Happy with whole experience.

The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier. All in all it was an education, certainly taught me a lesson!\",\n",

Security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. Club World was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks and food service served efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of Turkish Airlines. Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat. Abbreviated breakfast (no hot option) served an hour before landing. Arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule. Overall, an adequate flight, but the inflight experience was well below BA's competitors.\",\n",

If flying solo it's not a big issue, but with any companion (in this case I was with my son of 10) it would have been an issue to be separate. This also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. Lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. On board service was decent. Professional, courteous and friendly attendants. Toilets in the second half of the flight weren't too clean. Flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep. The aircraft did not have WiFi.\",\n",

Food was tasteless and I did skip a meal in the end - during one of the snack times we weren't given the options by our FA but the guy sat next to us who was served by another FA was given different options. Inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old. To ensure that I sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.

I was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door. Every person was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible. I witnessed such kindness and this is what I have come to expect and value from British Airways.

I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.\",\n",

As it was a night flight, my wife and I had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. Any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance.

For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. They were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This is very rude and extremely unprofessional.

During the dinner, I was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake. For the breakfast, the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals (up until 40 minutes before landing, they were still serving), I waited for my turn but no food came so I asked. Instead of them explaining and apologising, I had to ask where is my food. They said that they ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled in. While I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. Also, it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew (I thought they should have their own?). It was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes, and out it came a cabin crew. Very interesting experience.',\n",
       " 'Worst business class I flew, you are facing a stranger for the entire flight. Also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me, i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face. Dreadful food, a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staff. The bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food. They also ran out of the appetiser. I was told sorry, we ran out of satay, and other passengers have already ordered them. Therefore, please select another option.',\n",
       " \"Beijing to London. Service at the British Airways business class counter at Beijing airport was pleasant. The business lounge was quiet when we were there, however, food options were very limited, we were there in the morning, the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options. Onboard, service was really good, quite personal and attentive, which made a difference from the service on the way out to Beijing. Food was as good a you'd expect to get on board, I managed to get a window seat, which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board. Entertainment options were good.\",\n",
       " \"London to Beijing. Left from T5 at Heathrow, service is very speedy, you can use the fast track entrance which is swift. I didn't think much of the business lounge, food was more like canteen food, we were there around lunchtime, I ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps, later around 3pm they brought out some sandwiches, this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime. There were many drinks available, wine was ok. I tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working, this was also disappointing. With regards to the service on board the flight, it was ok, however, they collected my breakfast card, but not my husbands, so he nearly missed out on breakfast, the next morning, they offered my husband a bread roll, but not me, it seemed there was not much structure to the service, which meant they missed things. The entertainment that was available was good.\",\n",
       " 'Bangkok to London. The worst long haul carrier I have flown with. A very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy. The flights served the worst food. The Boeing 777 I flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices. The seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey. Meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hours. When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful. The dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens.',\n",
       " \"Food on this 4+ hours flight from Moscow to Heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of tea/coffee. The other London-Moscow flights provide a full meal. The cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers. When the flight touched down, it was 75 minutes before we disembarked, 6 British Airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator. My email to their CEO produced nothing except a plastic apology, even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation. Used to be BA was a world leader. They've followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction.\",\n",
       " 'Flew London Heathrow to Delhi Airport. Terminal 5 Concorde Room is impressive, clean but lacks service. Had to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend. When boarding the plane - no one to escort you to the seat. As you know there are only 8 First Class seats in B787-9. When it comes to meal choice, the main course I had selected (non veg Indian dish) was not available. When questioned why? - I was told, \"sorry, today we only loaded 3 of those dishes, and other passengers have already ordered them. Therefore, please select another option\". So, I skipped the main meal. I reminded the stewardess that I am not an upgrade passenger, I paid full price. It is shame that BA is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengers. I have never faced this situation with Virgin or Emirate, and have decided never to fly with BA if I can help.',\n",

Felt like a teenager again. Worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirty. Additonally, the IFE did not work. At the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. As the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. No IFE and no book reading possible. Crew were young and friendly, but obviously not experienced. Took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after take-off - they skipped our last four rows. Only after inquiring we got a tray. On arrival, new contractor at Terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available. Needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. Overall, poor experience with British Airways. They used to be good, but they try to be low-cost and charge legacy carrier prices. Will not work. To fly, to serve is no more adequate as their slogan.',\n",

BA have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. Seat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. The service was very good, attentive and prompt. The food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected.',\n",

The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. They should smile and be a little more considerate.

Meals - excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business.  My co passenger asked for a menu - answer - you are booked for veg meal - so that will be served. He asked for drinks menu - answer - \"What do you want?\"  The seat was claustrophobic,  closed and uncomfortable. The crew was unsmiling.',\n",

It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight. They ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. The cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight). I am gold on BA and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future.',\n",

Boarding was smooth and we left on time. Food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which I didn't eat, my dog liked it when I got home. For the price, you would expect a better meal. IFE was fine. Crew good.\",\n",

Upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in I was disappointed to see no separate check in. just a young girl with a couldn't care less attitude behind a temporary room divider. Off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. The lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. I love BA onboard crew in general but I will never fly BA again.\",\n",

This time I had to fly from Edinburgh to London Gatwick and I end up with mix feelings. Ground service in Edinburgh was outstanding. Expeditious, friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge. Service on board was average but friendly. Departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very well. The plane was an Airbus 319 in pretty good shape, clean and well maintained, however the space between seats was simply ridiculous. It was extremely small even for a midsize person. There would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work. Happily the person in front of me did not recline, that could have been a disaster. Very bad. Of course there was no entertainment. There was food and beverages for purchase. Due to the space between seats I would avoid flying with BA in short haul flights.',\n",
       " \"Could British Airways get any worse? Flew Chicago - London Heathrow in Upper Deck / Club World, of ancient B747-400, British Airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. The seats are the crazy / odd facing each other, with a rude screen, and are terribly uncomfortable / narrow. They must be at least a decade out of date. The food / wine was simply awful, and they didn't have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. The crew were young, uneducated, and unprofessional. They were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn't seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flight. WHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt? I can give you the answer: They have a monopoly from the UK to the USA, and back, and no legitimate competition.\",\n",
       " 'Flew on British Airways from Athens to London. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. At the age of 20 years, the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating. Apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time. Unfortunately BA has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but I guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive.',\n",

However having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. Only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. Aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. Screen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking at. We have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this BA flight, which I think is shameful for the national carrier.',\n",
       " \"I've been flying to Bombay for the last seven years to teach there. For most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time. Terminal 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate. Boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded. Logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when I questioned one of the staff, I was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  The flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than Jet's, the food good, and the service great. The steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative. IN economy class, I can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff. I can book the seat of my choice earlier if I wish to pay, and that was what I wanted to do with my Avios points, but you cannot.  I was told that several Executive Club members and Avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that BA might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with Avios points. BA, judging from this experience, does not know whether it is a full-exercise or a low-cost airline.\",\n",
       " \"Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.\",\n",
       " 'Flew London Heathrow to Prague. Bad service. Had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze. Arrogant staff. Not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments. I fly the route a few times a month. British Airways sometimes uses airport bus instead of air bridge. And there are frequent delays. What’s the difference between Ryanair and BA again please? Ah, the price! The only reason I give 2/10 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely.',\n",

After couple of hours over the call, I am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from MSY to DFW and London and Hyd and the layover is very short and I am very tense as I don't have any options to choose.

The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. As always with BA the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude. However I would probably still choose BA to Cape Town in order to fly direct.',\n",

Chicken curry was questionable or again Spinach Lasagne - just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn't mean they what spinach with every meal, there are some very nice alternatives out there. We were not offered Tea or Coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive. I would think twice before traveling with BA again. I thought they were meant to be our flagship Airline.\",\n",

The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. Come on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel? What planet are you on?',\n",

I literally had to run to find my way through Heathrow to to board my connection. As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones. No big deal, but still.\",\n",

I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future.

The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery.

       " \"Bangkok to Lisbon via Heathrow. We booked our flight tickets directly on BA site since July 2017 for the travelling date of December 24, 2017. One day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (BKK > LHR) without prior notice through any communication channels (email, sms text) by BA. After many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in Thailand. However, we managed to talk to the customer services team in UK. She informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). The assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the BKK > LHR flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from LHR to LIS. The only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. We had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online 24 hours before the flight. If we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  We were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but BA's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. Finally, we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on Christmas eve. I find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. This event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiences. We chose British Airways in hopes of a seamless and stress-free travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help.\",\n",

Too many options in business to put up with this ‘low cost’ service at premium fares.',\n",
       " 'Gatwick to Tobago. Many years since I\\'ve flown in BA club class. Interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn\\'t turned up. Floor around seat not vacuumed properly. Looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. FA took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. Invited over PA system to read High Life magazine - not in seat pocket - had to ask. Pre-flight drinks served ok. When asked for meal choice, options didn\\'t correspond with what was on menu. Asked FA if I had wrong menu. FA insisted it was right menu. Looked again and FA said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. Meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. Seat was comfortable, if snug. Ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you\\'re in an aisle seat. Meal tray not horizontal. Didn\\'t bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. Flight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. Arrived Tobago 5 hrs late. Return overnight flight left Tobago on time. Old school FAs on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusive. Don\\'t think BA trains them like that any more. Meal tray came with dessert already on it I hadn\\'t selected. When converted to bed, seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can\\'t bend your legs, as I do, in sleep. Got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. Seems fairly common for FAs on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking, if you\\'re obviously awake, if they can get you anything. Not on this flight. I guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring \"Club Kitchen\". Breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early. I can remember when a flight on BA club class was something to look forward to. Cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service. Not so any more, based on these 2 flights.',\n",

This flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class: passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet. Why pay more to fly business then? Dreadful! Flew in from Chicago to Heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest I’ve ever seen and with awful food. The controls in my first class seat did not work either. British Airways is fast going down the drains. Avoid!',\n",

My full-size cabin bag was given a 'yellow tag' and I had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full.

The current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair.\",\n",

When I called in (after waiting for 45 minutes on hold), I was told it was due to 'Operational Requirements'. A lot of back and forth, but the bottom line, BA could not get me back to YVR until Thursday. I could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though. I was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home. I am flying Air Canada when I return to the UK in February. At least if they cancel my flight, they will make a better effort to get me back home.\",\n",

Had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with Iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for Business Class flights BA still wanted £20 per person each way to pre book our seats. We tried to check in on line and were unable to. When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport. This flight had been booked since March 2017 and no one had raised this The assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage. We were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to Madrid the seats were the same as Economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat. We were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard We were, we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in Club World. We were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that's just greedy.\",\n",

I was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabrück but was told I could file online. That is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept American Airlines strap tag numbers. I tried to call the number I was given but the agents in Madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after I explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage office. I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However, I did not still see my suitcase until four days later. Now I am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor's consultation, and replacement medication). On another topic, £1.80 for a tin of coca cola?\",\n",

When I asked the stewardess to assist, she looked at me like I was such a nuisance, made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper.  Between 3-4am in the morning, I went in search of snacks. Found the cabin staff in the kitchen area. When I asked, please may I have some snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. Not one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), they kept serving the person next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn't matter that they blocked my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuse me, please can we, nothing. Rudeness at it's best. If you asked anything, the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore, and made one feel like you were being a burden.\",\n",
       " 'London to Bangkok. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. On board I offered a pre Champagne or water. Once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. Meal pre ordered online. I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 January. Well done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again.',\n",
       " 'What I have to say. “To fly, to serve”, a very well respected motto. British Airways is always a good choice. I was flying business class from LGW to FCO, everything was excellent! The crew were really nice for the whole flight, I was travelling solo and I had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food. We got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice (I got champagne and salmon!) everything was lly tasty. We departed and landed on time (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and I really appreciate this every time.) So, what to say, British Airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best European airlines. Their success is surely deserved.',\n",
       " \"San Jose, CA to London Heathrow round-trip in Club World. Had originally booked in Premium Economy but received upgrade offers from British Airways that were too go to pass up. Extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying out of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home. Overall very pleased with British Airways and the service provided. Access to lounges at both airports another plus ! No complaints from me. Will look to fly BA again later this year. Just hope they have more offers for Business Class.\",\n",

Product must be about 15 years out of date. Food was of poor quality. No mid-flight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches.  Second meal was tiny. Arrived at a bus gate in London. No bus appeared for about 30 minutes. Crew blamed the bus providing company. Overall an awful experience I do not intend to repeat.\",\n",

Nice crew, on time departure and a breakfast tray, which I did not expect. On the flight back A319 to Heathrow and you need to buy on board. Don't understand the concept of BA. It's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. They should decide, if they are a full-service airline or low cost. I understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than Lufthansa  and a completely different story, if compared to easyjet. Easyjet is not offering any great service, but you wouldn't expect it. With BA prices are like full-service, but value for money is much worse than easyjet or Eurowings.\",\n",

The day I was supposed to fly in the evening, I received text when I was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that I had to leave in middle. After talking to one of the agents for hour and a half, I was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from Charlotte instead of New York. In order to get this new flight I had to be at JFK Airport at 1:45 pm. To make this happen, I had to skip all last minute arrangements. The flight from Charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to London. Our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours. On top of longer and uncomfortable commuting, I was unable to sit with my children. The meal I requested was not available on the new flight. Absolute worst experience! While flying back from London to New York on November 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn’t have our requested meal available! It was my first experience with British Airways and I’ll make sure it’s the last one. On my flight back to New York I requested water to one of the attendants and she didn’t turn back for 9 minutes! I reminded her. She said she has been very busy. No apology, no courtesy, nothing. A big name like British Airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff.',\n",

BA and the rest of the European airlines cant quite keep up with the middle eastern airlines in terms of aircraft (Emirates, Etihad etc always seem to have the latest models) but the service, food, check-in, luggage allowance etc was all good. Too many people put BA down but thats just the British way - we should get behind out national carrier.',\n",
       " \"Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine. The advantage of London City is, apart from the distance to London, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride.\",\n",
       " \"Flew British Airways from London to Cape Town. Where to start! Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it. You used to be such a wonderful airline, flying our country's colours proudly and we were proud of you, it's almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers.\",\n",
       " 'The First Class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish. The seats were very comfortable and completely functional. Entertainment choices were current, varied, and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety. The cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. The food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience. The breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience. There is no Wi-Fi available on this aircraft type.',\n",
       " 'Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. Flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but BA really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.',\n",
       " \"Las Vegas to Manchester via London. Fairly dire as always. BA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. Perfect partner for AA. So I get on board and am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly a low cost airline? There no difference whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. And what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to Vegas? A starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. No oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate it. The main was tomato pasta or curry. The curry was so appalling I ate none of it. The chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. I cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. No cheese, crackers these days, nothing. Served with cold tea. I really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. The driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! Then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. I have another flight in May which is non-refundable, I am desperately hoping they move my flight so I can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. This is not a full service airline. It is fully no frills. The only exception is, I think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. The airline is a national embarrassment. The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. Fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more. I'm going to try Lufthansa, or Thomas Cook, though I admit I'm dreading that prospect.\",\n",
       " 'London to Dubai.  This was a terrible flight with grubby cabins, same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying.

       " \"Amsterdam to London. Service Ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. Every two years or so I fly with BA, and every two years I am reminded just why I don't normally fly with them. Whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to Milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline. The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.\",\n",

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. Inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown too. Food was standard airline food, neither good or bad but ok. BA has been taken over for air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haul only.',\n",

Our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. Cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. I agree. Flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. No assistance provided by BA. Told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out. Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for. BA is now as bad as Ryanair so will never fly with them again. They're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.\",\n",

Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium Economy I have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. The plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. I finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. The personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that I could actually hear anything. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. I find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. I needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time. I booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more, I got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.',\n",

Again, as usual, Club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad.

To top everything off the crew couldn’t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about a negative experience they’ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don’t waste your money flying BA - I’ve had far more positive experiences on Ryanair.',\n",

I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. After this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly doubt I will use British Airways again.\",\n",

Needless to say that because we are away for Christmas & New Year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. I repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that BA and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. Because we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. The tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items.\",\n",
       " \"Las Vegas to London. Absolutely horrendous experience! We were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours (in high temperatures with no air conditioning - the passengers were all sweating) before the plane took off. Kept saying it would be 10 mins and then 15 mins. 2 hours odd later we finally took off. Economy on BA is horrible. Seats are uncomfortable, no space, can hardly get refreshments (the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water), food is bad. To make it worse, when we landed in London we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because BA didn't have a spare arrivals gate. Due to all the delays, we had to run like mad people to get from Heathrow to Gatwick in time for our onward flight with BA. Against all odds, we got their with 30 mins to spare (plane hadn't boarded yet) but they casually said we were too late and said we'd have to fly the next day. Absolute joke, I won't be flying with BA again when I have a choice.\",\n",
       " 'Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through T5. Unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. B747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. The food was OK. The biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. No smiles or even a \"welcome on board\" whilst walking down the aisle. On arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. The service provided by BA has significantly declined over the past few years. Even the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven\\'t got cabins that compete with todays market. Also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat. Very very disappointed that I didn\\'t choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price.',\n",
       " 'I was on a flight from New York JFK - Budapest via London Heathrow on 9th December The flight was delayed 6hrs, when I arrived to London I got information that my flight to Budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow. That was on the 10th December. I was there with a few thousends other passengers from BA, nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. After waiting 2-3 hrs for my suitcase I was struggling with cold at terminal 4. Someon from BA took us to terminal 5. Today is 12th December and I am still in London without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to Budapest. I paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels BA offered are fully booked. This is not what you normally expect from British national carrier airlines. Very poor website, nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre, they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense.',\n",
       " 'Flew Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight delayed by four hours - which is understandable due to the weather in the UK at the time. The inflight entertainment was awful. It was good for only a short haul journey. Very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens. Plus they kept stalling. The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. We were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. The food was average and I was very hungry throughout the service. As far as I am aware, on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible - I don’t call being starved very comfortable! Other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey. Why can’t you? You used to be the best and now you’re budget. I won’t be flying with British Airways again.',\n",
       " 'I was quite disappointed with my experience with British Airways. First of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in LHR. However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR. Once on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying Ryanair or British Airways. Seats were okay but nothing outstanding - same with the crew.',\n",
       " \"Flew British Airways to Pisa due to flight times and BA miles. Overall a poor economy class product. The seats were really tight. Staff were ok, but seemed stressed. You had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of BA and they predict other airlines will follow suit. Difficult to get a glass of water. Three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. At check-in their automated system failed so it was done manually - thank goodness for carbon units still employed by BA. Overall BA is dramatically failing. Those who have BA miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. BA is no longer UK's national airline. The magic of Alex Cruz and Willie Walsh is not working if it ever did. Avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets. Loyalty does not pay.\",\n",
       " \"London to Toulouse. British Airways is no longer a full service airline. To compete with EasyJet and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced and not that great. Secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. This was the case in this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to Pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least offer people water - it is a human right. The seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope that this is not true. The only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. Customer care and service has gone. Avoid BA if you can. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers. They are better and more responsive.\",\n",
       " 'Great flight out from London to Santiago. Lovely, friendly crew. Goats cheese salad to start, fish pie for main, good selection of wines and managed 7 hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming back! 787-900 is a fantastic aircraft even if you do have to climb over some feet to get out, the window seats are very private. Flying this aircraft to Seychelles in May and really looking forward to it. Just waiting to try the new bedding now and catering. Just flown out to KUL and BA are way ahead of MH.',\n",
       " \"London to Rome. It's been a while since I last flew on BA and it certainly has changed. While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned. Presumably, this is due to the competition from Easyjet and Ryanair as well as it's CEO hailing from Vueling. I suppose it's only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and BA flies out of LHR.\",\n",
       " \"London to Manchester. Hard to complain about a flight which last 35 mins but I was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection. This flight used to include complimentary tea/bacon sandwich until the much criticized move to M&S inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isn't available anymore. All things considered, that is understandable.\",\n",
       " \"London to Seattle, a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about. Efficient and professional service, meal service fine, good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra. IFE selection was perhaps a little limited. Bags slow to arrive at Seattle but don't put that on BA.\",\n",
       " \"Seattle to London. Good experience all round and nothing much to complain about. FA's efficient and friendly, flight was on time. Meal quality was average. Overall, believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although I had cashed in some miles to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy. Major complaint is BA's policy of charging to book a seat - it's extremely irritating and stressful, especially in premium economy upwards.\",\n",
